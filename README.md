https://www.mjbauer.biz/Sigma6_M0_synth_weblog.htm\
\
this PCB extends its capabilities to modules without 16pin socket that require a +5v power supply .\
\
For all versions:\
External power supply in +5v via mini USB is possible.\
The components of a +5v regulation with a 7805, using the +12v supply of the Eurorack system, can be added.\
An external DC 9/12v PSU entry is also available.\
\
Version 1.0 is sufficient with a single 16pin socket and jumper to use the +5v of the Eurorack PSU.\
Versions 2.0 and 2.1 include a MIDI Bus extension. Version 2.1 has three 16pin sockets.\
\
Versions 1.0 and 2.0 have a minimum format (49.5mmx 84mm).\
Version 2.1 is 3U (49.5mmx106.5mm);}
